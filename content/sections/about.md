Upon graduation, he obtained his master's degree with Dieter Hennings at the University of Kentucky College of Fine Arts and was selected to study privately with the renowned musician Angelo Gilardino in Vercelli, Italy.

Collin's performing experience is extensive. He has toured across much of America and Spain as a soloist and as part of various ensembles in festivals such as Austin City Limits, CHAMBERart Madrid, and the Celedonio Romero Guitar Institute. Highlights of his career include winning the Haire Guitar Competition, two consecutive first place finishes at the National Brownsville Guitar Duet Competition, and being recognized as a "Rising Young Artist" by the Opera Club of the Villages.

Most recently, Collin was chosen as a soloist to premiere the work "Malague√±a de Jotron" at the Armstrong Theater with the renowned Los Romeros Guitar Quartet, as well as appearances with the Juliani Ensemble.

As a musician, Collin strives to bring to life the intimate nature and inherent poetry of the guitar through a beautiful tone and a sensitive touch. This can be heard throughout his debut album "A Musical Portrait", where he performs rare works by Angelo Gilardino and Graciela Agudelo, amongst other more seminal compositions.

An adamant performer of chamber music, Collin is one half of The Muse Duo. This guitar and piano duo was formed at the Eastman School of Music with pianist and composer Robert Benedict. Just months after playing together for the first time, The Muse Duo toured parts of the United States. Currently, the Muse Duo is championing new music for this rare setting of instruments through the composition of new works by Robert, as well as premiere performances of these compositions. Their debut album "Experiments" was released in April 2023.

Collin is also a co-founder of the Off the Dock Chamber Music Festival, an intimate festival dedicated to bringing chamber music to the beautiful Finger Lakes region of New York, providing a platform for emerging artists and fostering community through music.
